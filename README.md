# PokerHandKata
A short Kata I did to learn JavaScript language, using Test Driven Development.

At the root of the project a simple "mocha" command will launch all the tests.

Or you can also run a "mocha -w" which will lauch a continous testing environment, meaning that when you will save a file of the project, tests will be lauched each time.
